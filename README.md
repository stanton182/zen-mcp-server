  <b>🤖 Claude + [Gemini / O3 / or Both] = Your Ultimate AI Development Team</b>
</div>

<br/>

The ultimate development partners for Claude - a Model Context Protocol server that gives Claude access to multiple AI models for enhanced code analysis, 
problem-solving, and collaborative development.

**Features true AI orchestration with conversations that continue across tasks** - Give Claude a complex
task and let it orchestrate between models automatically. Claude stays in control, performs the actual work, 
but gets perspectives from the best AI for each subtask. Claude can switch between different tools _and_ models mid-conversation, 
with context carrying forward seamlessly.

**Example Workflow - Claude Code:**
1. Performs its own reasoning
2. Uses Gemini Pro to deeply [`analyze`](#6-analyze---smart-file-analysis) the code in question for a second opinion
3. Switches to O3 to continue [`chatting`](#1-chat---general-development-chat--collaborative-thinking) about its findings 
4. Uses Flash to evaluate formatting suggestions from O3
5. Performs the actual work after taking in feedback from all three
6. Returns to Pro for a [`precommit`](#4-precommit---pre-commit-validation) review

All within a single conversation thread! Gemini Pro in step 6 _knows_ what was recommended by O3 in step 3! Taking that context
and review into consideration to aid with its pre-commit review.

**Think of it as Claude Code _for_ Claude Code.** This MCP isn't magic. It's just **super-glue**.

**Prompt Used:**
```
Study the code properly, think deeply about what this does and then see if there's any room for improvement in
terms of performance optimizations, brainstorm with gemini on this to get feedback and then confirm any change by
first adding a unit test with `measure` and measuring current code and then implementing the optimization and
measuring again to ensure it improved, then share results. Check with gemini in between as you make tweaks.
```

The final implementation resulted in a 26% improvement in JSON parsing performance for the selected library, reducing processing time through targeted, collaborative optimizations guided by Gemini’s analysis and Claude’s refinement.

## Quickstart (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed ([Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Git
- **Windows users**: WSL2 is required for Claude Code CLI

### 1. Get API Keys (at least one required)
- **Gemini**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and generate an API key. For best results with Gemini 2.5 Pro, use a paid API key as the free tier has limited access to the latest models.
- **OpenAI**: Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to get an API key for O3 model access.

### 2. Clone and Set Up

```bash
# Clone to your preferred location
git clone https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server.git
cd zen-mcp-server

# Beginner-friendly CLI
python zen_cli.py setup   # prompts for API keys and creates .env
python zen_cli.py start   # builds images and starts services

# Or run the setup script directly
./setup-docker.sh
```

**What this does:**
- **Builds Docker images** with all dependencies (including Redis for conversation threading)
- **Creates .env file** (automatically uses `$GEMINI_API_KEY` and `$OPENAI_API_KEY` if set in environment)
- **Starts Redis service** for AI-to-AI conversation memory
- **Starts MCP server** with providers based on available API keys
- **Adds Zen to Claude Code automatically**

### 3. Add Your API Keys

```bash
# Edit .env to add your API keys (if not already set in environment)
nano .env

# The file will contain:
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here  # For Gemini models
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here  # For O3 model
# WORKSPACE_ROOT=/Users/your-username  (automatically configured)

# Note: At least one API key is required (Gemini or OpenAI)
```

### 4. Configure Claude

#### If Setting up for Claude Code
Run the following commands on the terminal to add the MCP directly to Claude Code
```bash
# Add the MCP server directly via Claude Code CLI
claude mcp add zen -s user -- docker exec -i zen-mcp-server python server.py

# List your MCP servers to verify
claude mcp list

# Remove when needed
claude mcp remove zen -s user

# You may need to remove an older version of this MCP after it was renamed:
claude mcp remove gemini -s user
```
Now run `claude` on the terminal for it to connect to the newly added mcp server. If you were already running a `claude` code session,
please exit and start a new session.

#### If Setting up for Claude Desktop

- Open Claude Desktop
- Go to **Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config**

This will open a folder revealing `claude_desktop_config.json`.

2. ** Update Docker Configuration**

The setup script shows you the exact configuration. It looks like this. When you ran `setup-docker.sh` it should
have produced a configuration for you to copy:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zen": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "exec",
        "-i",
        "zen-mcp-server",
        "python",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Paste the above into `claude_desktop_config.json`. If you have several other MCP servers listed, simply add this below the rest after a `,` comma:
```json
  ... other mcp servers ... ,

  "zen": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "exec",
        "-i",
        "zen-mcp-server",
        "python",
        "server.py"
      ]
  }
```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**
Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

### 5. Start Using It!

Just ask Claude naturally:
- "Think deeper about this architecture design with zen" → Claude picks best model + `thinkdeep`
- "Using zen perform a code review of this code for security issues" → Claude might pick Gemini Pro + `codereview`
- "Use zen and debug why this test is failing, the bug might be in my_class.swift" → Claude might pick O3 + `debug`
- "With zen, analyze these files to understand the data flow" → Claude picks appropriate model + `analyze`
- "Use flash to suggest how to format this code based on the specs mentioned in policy.md" → Uses Gemini Flash specifically
- "Think deeply about this and get o3 to debug this logic error I found in the checkOrders() function" → Uses O3 specifically
- "Brainstorm scaling strategies with pro. Study the code, pick your preferred strategy and debate with pro to settle on two best approaches" → Uses Gemini Pro specifically

> **Remember:** Claude remains in control — but **you** are the true orchestrator.  
> You're the prompter, the guide, the puppeteer.  
> Your prompt decides when Claude brings in Gemini, Flash, O3 — or handles it solo.

- **Web search capability**: Analyzes when web searches would be helpful and recommends specific searches for Claude to perform, ensuring access to current documentation and best practices

### 2. `thinkdeep` - Extended Reasoning Partner

**Get a second opinion to augment Claude's own extended thinking**

**Thinking Mode:** Default is `high` (16,384 tokens) for deep analysis. Claude will automatically choose the best mode based on complexity - use `low` for quick validations, `medium` for standard problems, `high` for complex issues (default), or `max` for extremely complex challenges requiring deepest analysis.

#### Example Prompt:

```
Think deeper about my authentication design with pro using max thinking mode and brainstorm to come up 
with the best architecture for my project
```

**Key Features:**
- **Uses Gemini's specialized thinking models** for enhanced reasoning capabilities
- Provides a second opinion on Claude's analysis
- Challenges assumptions and identifies edge cases Claude might miss
- Offers alternative perspectives and approaches
- Validates architectural decisions and design patterns
- Can reference specific files for context: `"Use gemini to think deeper about my API design with reference to api/routes.py"`

- **Web search capability**: When enabled (default: true), identifies areas where current documentation or community solutions would strengthen the analysis and suggests specific searches for Claude

### 3. `codereview` - Professional Code Review  
**Comprehensive code analysis with prioritized feedback**

**Thinking Mode:** Default is `medium` (8,192 tokens). Use `high` for security-critical code (worth the extra tokens) or `low` for quick style checks (saves ~6k tokens).

#### Example Prompts:

```
Perform a codereview with gemini pro and review auth.py for security issues and potential vulnerabilities.
I need an actionable plan but break it down into smaller quick-wins that we can implement and test rapidly 
```

**Key Features:**
- Issues prioritized by severity (🔴 CRITICAL → 🟢 LOW)
- Supports specialized reviews: security, performance, quick
- Can enforce coding standards: `"Use gemini to review src/ against PEP8 standards"`
- Filters by severity: `"Get gemini to review auth/ - only report critical vulnerabilities"`

### 4. `precommit` - Pre-Commit Validation
**Comprehensive review of staged/unstaged git changes across multiple repositories**

**Thinking Mode:** Default is `medium` (8,192 tokens). Use `high` or `max` for critical releases when thorough validation justifies the token cost.

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/584adfa6-d252-49b4-b5b0-0cd6e97fb2c6" width="950">
</div>

**Prompt Used:**
```
Now use gemini and perform a review and precommit and ensure original requirements are met, no duplication of code or
logic, everything should work as expected
```

How beautiful is that? Claude used `precommit` twice and `codereview` once and actually found and fixed two critical errors before commit!

#### Example Prompts:

```
Use zen and perform a thorough precommit ensuring there aren't any new regressions or bugs introduced
```

**Key Features:**
- **Recursive repository discovery** - finds all git repos including nested ones

- **Configurable scope** - review staged, unstaged, or compare against branches
- **Security focused** - catches exposed secrets, vulnerabilities in new code
- **Smart truncation** - handles large diffs without exceeding context limits

**Parameters:**
- `path`: Starting directory to search for repos (default: current directory)
- `original_request`: The requirements for context
- `compare_to`: Compare against a branch/tag instead of local changes
- `review_type`: full|security|performance|quick
- `severity_filter`: Filter by issue severity
- `max_depth`: How deep to search for nested repos
### 5. `debug` - Expert Debugging Assistant
**Root cause analysis for complex problems**

**Thinking Mode:** Default is `medium` (8,192 tokens). Use `high` for tricky bugs (investment in finding root cause) or `low` for simple errors (save tokens).

#### Example Prompts:

**Basic Usage:**
```
"Use gemini to debug this TypeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'"
"Get gemini to debug why my API returns 500 errors with the full stack trace: [paste traceback]"
```

**Key Features:**
- Generates multiple ranked hypotheses for systematic debugging
- Accepts error context, stack traces, and logs
- Can reference relevant files for investigation
- Supports runtime info and previous attempts
- Provides structured root cause analysis with validation steps
- Can request additional context when needed for thorough analysis
- **Web search capability**: When enabled (default: true), identifies when searching for error messages, known issues, or documentation would help solve the problem and recommends specific searches for Claude
### 6. `analyze` - Smart File Analysis
**General-purpose code understanding and exploration**

**Thinking Mode:** Default is `medium` (8,192 tokens). Use `high` for architecture analysis (comprehensive insights worth the cost) or `low` for quick file overviews (save ~6k tokens).

#### Example Prompts:

**Basic Usage:**
```
"Use gemini to analyze main.py to understand how it works"
"Get gemini to do an architecture analysis of the src/ directory"
```

**Key Features:**
- Analyzes single files or entire directories
- Supports specialized analysis types: architecture, performance, security, quality
- Uses file paths (not content) for clean terminal output
- Can identify patterns, anti-patterns, and refactoring opportunities
- **Web search capability**: When enabled with `use_websearch` (default: true), the model can request Claude to perform web searches and share results back to enhance analysis with current documentation, design patterns, and best practices
### 7. `get_version` - Server Information
```
"Get zen to show its version"
```

## Tool Parameters

```

## Collaborative Workflows

### Design → Review → Implement
```
Think hard about designing and developing a fun calculator app in swift. Review your design plans with o3, taking in
their suggestions but keep the feature-set realistic and doable without adding bloat. Begin implementing and in between
implementation, get a codereview done by Gemini Pro and chat with Flash if you need to for creative directions.   
```

### Code → Review → Fix
```
Implement a new screen where the locations taken from the database display on a map, with pins falling from
the top and landing with animation. Once done, codereview with gemini pro and o3 both and ask them to critique your
work. Fix medium to critical bugs / concerns / issues and show me the final product
```

### Debug → Analyze → Solution → Precommit Check → Publish
```
Take a look at these log files saved under subfolder/diagnostics.log there's a bug where the user says the app
crashes at launch. Think hard and go over each line, tallying it with corresponding code within the project. After
you've performed initial investigation, ask gemini pro to analyze the log files and the related code where you 
suspect lies the bug and then formulate and implement a bare minimal fix. Must not regress. Perform a precommit
with zen in the end using gemini pro to confirm we're okay to publish the fix 
```

### Tool Selection Guidance
To help choose the right tool for your needs:

**Decision Flow:**
1. **Have a specific error/exception?** → Use `debug`
2. **Want to find bugs/issues in code?** → Use `codereview`
3. **Want to understand how code works?** → Use `analyze`
4. **Have analysis that needs extension/validation?** → Use `thinkdeep`
5. **Want to brainstorm or discuss?** → Use `chat`

**Key Distinctions:**
- `analyze` vs `codereview`: analyze explains, codereview prescribes fixes
- `chat` vs `thinkdeep`: chat is open-ended, thinkdeep extends specific analysis
- `debug` vs `codereview`: debug diagnoses runtime errors, review finds static issues

## Thinking Modes - Managing Token Costs & Quality

**Claude automatically manages thinking modes based on task complexity**, but you can also manually control Gemini's reasoning depth to balance between response quality and token consumption. Each thinking mode uses a different amount of tokens, directly affecting API costs and response time.

### Thinking Modes & Token Budgets

These only apply to models that support customizing token usage for extended thinking, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro.

| Mode | Token Budget | Use Case | Cost Impact |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `minimal` | 128 tokens | Simple, straightforward tasks | Lowest cost |
| `low` | 2,048 tokens | Basic reasoning tasks | 16x more than minimal |
| `medium` | 8,192 tokens | **Default** - Most development tasks | 64x more than minimal |
| `high` | 16,384 tokens | Complex problems requiring thorough analysis (default for `thinkdeep`) | 128x more than minimal |
| `max` | 32,768 tokens | Exhaustive reasoning | 256x more than minimal |

### How to Use Thinking Modes

**Claude automatically selects appropriate thinking modes**, but you can override this by explicitly requesting a specific mode in your prompts. Remember: higher thinking modes = more tokens = higher cost but better quality:

#### Optimizing Token Usage & Costs

**In most cases, let Claude automatically manage thinking modes** for optimal balance of cost and quality. Override manually when you have specific requirements:

**Use lower modes (`minimal`, `low`) to save tokens when:**
- Doing simple formatting or style checks
- Getting quick explanations of basic concepts
- Working with straightforward code
- You need faster responses
- Working within tight token budgets

**Use higher modes (`high`, `max`) when quality justifies the cost:**
- Debugging complex issues (worth the extra tokens to find root causes)
- Reviewing security-critical code (cost of tokens < cost of vulnerabilities)
- Analyzing system architecture (comprehensive analysis saves development time)
- Finding subtle bugs or edge cases
- Working on performance optimizations

**Token Cost Examples:**
- `minimal` (128 tokens) vs `max` (32,768 tokens) = 256x difference in thinking tokens
- For a simple formatting check, using `minimal` instead of the default `medium` saves ~8,000 thinking tokens
- For critical security reviews, the extra tokens in `high` or `max` mode are a worthwhile investment

**Examples by scenario:**
```
# Quick style check with o3
"Use flash to review formatting in utils.py"

# Security audit with o3
"Get o3 to do a security review of auth/ with thinking mode high"

# Complex debugging, letting claude pick the best model
"Use zen to debug this race condition with max thinking mode"

# Architecture analysis with Gemini 2.5 Pro
"Analyze the entire src/ directory architecture with high thinking using pro"
```

## Advanced Features

### AI-to-AI Conversation Threading

This server enables **true AI collaboration** between Claude and multiple AI models (Gemini, O3), where they can coordinate and question each other's approaches:

**How it works:**
- **Gemini can ask Claude follow-up questions** to clarify requirements or gather more context
- **Claude can respond** with additional information, files, or refined instructions
- **Claude can work independently** between exchanges - implementing solutions, gathering data, or performing analysis
- **Claude can return to Gemini** with progress updates and new context for further collaboration
- **Cross-tool continuation** - Start with one tool (e.g., `analyze`) and continue with another (e.g., `codereview`) using the same conversation thread
- **Both AIs coordinate their approaches** - questioning assumptions, validating solutions, and building on each other's insights
- Each conversation maintains full context while only sending incremental updates
- Conversations are automatically managed with Redis for persistence

**Example of Multi-Model AI Coordination:**
1. You: "Debate SwiftUI vs UIKit - which is better for iOS development?"
2. Claude (auto mode): "I'll orchestrate a debate between different models for diverse perspectives."
3. Gemini Pro: "From an architectural standpoint, SwiftUI's declarative paradigm and state management make it superior for maintainable, modern apps."
4. O3: "Logically analyzing the trade-offs: UIKit offers 15+ years of stability, complete control, and proven scalability. SwiftUI has <5 years maturity with ongoing breaking changes."
5. Claude: "Let me get Flash's quick take on developer experience..."
6. Gemini Flash: "SwiftUI = faster development, less code, better previews. UIKit = more control, better debugging, stable APIs."
7. **Claude's synthesis**: "Based on the multi-model analysis: Use SwiftUI for new projects prioritizing development speed, UIKit for apps requiring fine control or supporting older iOS versions."

**Asynchronous workflow example:**
- Claude can work independently between exchanges (analyzing code, implementing fixes, gathering data)
- Return to Gemini with progress updates and additional context  
- Each exchange shares only incremental information while maintaining full conversation history
- Automatically bypasses MCP's 25K token limits through incremental updates

**Enhanced collaboration features:**
- **Cross-questioning**: AIs can challenge each other's assumptions and approaches
- **Coordinated problem-solving**: Each AI contributes their strengths to complex problems
- **Context building**: Claude gathers information while Gemini provides deep analysis
- **Approach validation**: AIs can verify and improve each other's solutions
- **Cross-tool continuation**: Seamlessly continue conversations across different tools while preserving all context
- **Asynchronous workflow**: Conversations don't need to be sequential - Claude can work on tasks between exchanges, then return to Gemini with additional context and progress updates
- **Incremental updates**: Share only new information in each exchange while maintaining full conversation history
- **Automatic 25K limit bypass**: Each exchange sends only incremental context, allowing unlimited total conversation size
- Up to 5 exchanges per conversation with 1-hour expiry
- Thread-safe with Redis persistence across all tools

**Cross-tool & Cross-Model Continuation Example:**
```
1. Claude: "Analyze /src/auth.py for security issues"
   → Auto mode: Claude picks Gemini Pro for deep security analysis
   → Pro analyzes and finds vulnerabilities, provides continuation_id

2. Claude: "Review the authentication logic thoroughly"
   → Uses same continuation_id, but Claude picks O3 for logical analysis
   → O3 sees previous Pro analysis and provides logic-focused review

3. Claude: "Debug the auth test failures"
   → Same continuation_id, Claude keeps O3 for debugging
   → O3 provides targeted debugging with full context from both previous analyses

4. Claude: "Quick style check before committing"
   → Same thread, but Claude switches to Flash for speed
   → Flash quickly validates formatting with awareness of all previous fixes
```

### Working with Large Prompts

The MCP protocol has a combined request+response limit of approximately 25K tokens. This server intelligently works around this limitation by automatically handling large prompts as files:

**How it works:**
1. When you send a prompt larger than the configured limit (default: 50K characters ~10-12K tokens), the server detects this
2. It responds with a special status asking Claude to save the prompt to a file named `prompt.txt`
3. Claude saves the prompt and resends the request with the file path instead
4. The server reads the file content directly into Gemini's 1M token context
5. The full MCP token capacity is preserved for the response

**Example scenario:**
```
# You have a massive code review request with detailed context
User: "Use gemini to review this code: [50,000+ character detailed analysis]"

# Server detects the large prompt and responds:
Zen MCP: "The prompt is too large for MCP's token limits (>50,000 characters). 
Please save the prompt text to a temporary file named 'prompt.txt' and resend 
the request with an empty prompt string and the absolute file path included 
in the files parameter, along with any other files you wish to share as context."

# Claude automatically handles this:
- Saves your prompt to /tmp/prompt.txt
- Resends: "Use gemini to review this code" with files=["/tmp/prompt.txt", "/path/to/code.py"]

# Server processes the large prompt through Gemini's 1M context
# Returns comprehensive analysis within MCP's response limits
```

This feature ensures you can send arbitrarily large prompts to Gemini without hitting MCP's protocol limitations, while maximizing the available space for detailed responses.

### Dynamic Context Requests
Tools can request additional context from Claude during execution. When Gemini needs more information to provide a thorough analysis, it will ask Claude for specific files or clarification, enabling true collaborative problem-solving.

**Example:** If Gemini is debugging an error but needs to see a configuration file that wasn't initially provided, it can request: 
```json
{
  "status": "requires_clarification",
  "question": "I need to see the database configuration to understand this connection error",
  "files_needed": ["config/database.yml", "src/db_connection.py"]
}
```

Claude will then provide the requested files and Gemini can continue with a more complete analysis.

### Web Search Integration

**Smart web search recommendations for enhanced analysis**

Web search is now enabled by default for all tools. Instead of performing searches directly, Gemini intelligently analyzes when additional information from the web would enhance its response and provides specific search recommendations for Claude to execute.

**How it works:**
1. Gemini analyzes the request and identifies areas where current documentation, API references, or community solutions would be valuable
2. It provides its analysis based on its training data
3. If web searches would strengthen the analysis, Gemini includes a "Recommended Web Searches for Claude" section
4. Claude can then perform these searches and incorporate the findings

**Example:**
```
User: "Use gemini to debug this FastAPI async error"

Gemini's Response:
[... debugging analysis ...]

**Recommended Web Searches for Claude:**
- "FastAPI async def vs def performance 2024" - to verify current best practices for async endpoints
- "FastAPI BackgroundTasks memory leak" - to check for known issues with the version you're using
- "FastAPI lifespan context manager pattern" - to explore proper resource management patterns

Claude can then search for these specific topics and provide you with the most current information.
```

**Benefits:**
- Always access to latest documentation and best practices
- Gemini focuses on reasoning about what information would help
- Claude maintains control over actual web searches
- More collaborative approach between the two AI assistants
- Reduces hallucination by encouraging verification of assumptions

**Web search control:**
Web search is enabled by default, allowing models to request Claude perform searches for current documentation and solutions. If you prefer the model to work only with its training data, you can disable web search:
```
"Use gemini to review this code with use_websearch false"
```

## Configuration

The server includes several configurable properties that control its behavior:

### Model Configuration

**🎯 Auto Mode (Recommended):**
Set `DEFAULT_MODEL=auto` in your .env file and Claude will intelligently select the best model for each task:

```env
# .env file
DEFAULT_MODEL=auto  # Claude picks the best model automatically

# API Keys (at least one required)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key    # Enables Gemini Pro & Flash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key    # Enables O3, O3-mini
```

**How Auto Mode Works:**
- Claude analyzes each request and selects the optimal model
- Model selection is based on task complexity, requirements, and model strengths
- You can always override: "Use flash for quick check" or "Use o3 to debug"

**Supported Models & When Claude Uses Them:**

| Model | Provider | Context | Strengths | Auto Mode Usage |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **`pro`** (Gemini 2.5 Pro) | Google | 1M tokens | Extended thinking (up to 32K tokens), deep analysis | Complex architecture, security reviews, deep debugging |
| **`flash`** (Gemini 2.0 Flash) | Google | 1M tokens | Ultra-fast responses | Quick checks, formatting, simple analysis |
| **`o3`** | OpenAI | 200K tokens | Strong logical reasoning | Debugging logic errors, systematic analysis |
| **`o3-mini`** | OpenAI | 200K tokens | Balanced speed/quality | Moderate complexity tasks |

**Manual Model Selection:**
You can specify a default model instead of auto mode:

```env
# Use a specific model by default
DEFAULT_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05  # Always use Gemini Pro
DEFAULT_MODEL=flash                         # Always use Flash
DEFAULT_MODEL=o3                           # Always use O3
```

**Per-Request Model Override:**
Regardless of your default setting, you can specify models per request:
- "Use **pro** for deep security analysis of auth.py"
- "Use **flash** to quickly format this code"
- "Use **o3** to debug this logic error"
- "Review with **o3-mini** for balanced analysis"

**Model Capabilities:**
- **Gemini Models**: Support thinking modes (minimal to max), web search, 1M context
- **O3 Models**: Excellent reasoning, systematic analysis, 200K context

### Temperature Defaults
Different tools use optimized temperature settings:
- **`TEMPERATURE_ANALYTICAL`**: `0.2` - Used for code review and debugging (focused, deterministic)
- **`TEMPERATURE_BALANCED`**: `0.5` - Used for general chat (balanced creativity/accuracy)
- **`TEMPERATURE_CREATIVE`**: `0.7` - Used for deep thinking and architecture (more creative)

### Logging Configuration
Control logging verbosity via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:
- **`DEBUG`**: Shows detailed operational messages, tool execution flow, conversation threading
- **`INFO`**: Shows general operational messages (default)
- **`WARNING`**: Shows only warnings and errors
- **`ERROR`**: Shows only errors

**Set in your .env file:**
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG  # For troubleshooting
LOG_LEVEL=INFO   # For normal operation (default)
```

**For Docker:**
```bash
# In .env file
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Or set directly when starting
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG docker compose up
```


## File Path Requirements

**All file paths must be absolute paths.**

When using any Gemini tool, always provide absolute paths:
```
✅ "Use gemini to analyze /Users/you/project/src/main.py"
❌ "Use gemini to analyze ./src/main.py"  (will be rejected)
```

### Security & File Access

By default, the server allows access to files within your home directory. This is necessary for the server to work with any file you might want to analyze from Claude.

**For Docker environments**, the `WORKSPACE_ROOT` environment variable is used to map your local directory to the internal `/workspace` directory, enabling the MCP to translate absolute file references correctly:

```json
"env": {
  "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-key",
  "WORKSPACE_ROOT": "/Users/you/project"  // Maps to /workspace inside Docker
}
```

This allows Claude to use absolute paths that will be correctly translated between your local filesystem and the Docker container.


## How System Prompts Work

The server uses carefully crafted system prompts to give each tool specialized expertise:

### Prompt Architecture
- **Centralized Prompts**: All system prompts are defined in `prompts/tool_prompts.py`
- **Tool Integration**: Each tool inherits from `BaseTool` and implements `get_system_prompt()`
- **Prompt Flow**: `User Request → Tool Selection → System Prompt + Context → Gemini Response`

### Specialized Expertise
Each tool has a unique system prompt that defines its role and approach:
- **`thinkdeep`**: Acts as a senior development partner, challenging assumptions and finding edge cases
- **`codereview`**: Expert code reviewer with security/performance focus, uses severity levels
- **`debug`**: Systematic debugger providing root cause analysis and prevention strategies
- **`analyze`**: Code analyst focusing on architecture, patterns, and actionable insights

### Customization
To modify tool behavior, you can:
1. Edit prompts in `prompts/tool_prompts.py` for global changes
2. Override `get_system_prompt()` in a tool class for tool-specific changes
3. Use the `temperature` parameter to adjust response style (0.2 for focused, 0.7 for creative)

## Testing

### Unit Tests (No API Key Required)
The project includes comprehensive unit tests that use mocks and don't require a Gemini API key:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Simulation Tests (API Key Required)
To test the MCP server with comprehensive end-to-end simulation:

```bash
# Set your API keys (at least one required)
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Run all simulation tests (default: uses existing Docker containers)
python communication_simulator_test.py

# Run specific tests only
python communication_simulator_test.py --tests basic_conversation content_validation

# Run with Docker rebuild (if needed)
python communication_simulator_test.py --rebuild-docker

# List available tests
python communication_simulator_test.py --list-tests
```

The simulation tests validate:
- Basic conversation flow with continuation
- File handling and deduplication
- Cross-tool conversation threading
- Redis memory persistence
- Docker container integration

### GitHub Actions CI/CD
The project includes GitHub Actions workflows that:

- **✅ Run unit tests automatically** - No API key needed, uses mocks
- **✅ Test on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12** - Ensures compatibility
- **✅ Run linting and formatting checks** - Maintains code quality

The CI pipeline works without any secrets and will pass all tests using mocked responses. Simulation tests require API key secrets (`GEMINI_API_KEY` and/or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) to run the communication simulator.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

**"Connection failed" in Claude Desktop**
- Ensure Docker services are running: `docker compose ps`
- Check if the container name is correct: `docker ps` to see actual container names
- Verify your .env file has at least one valid API key (GEMINI_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY)

**"API key environment variable is required"**
- Edit your .env file and add at least one API key (Gemini or OpenAI)
- Restart services: `docker compose restart`

**Container fails to start**
- Check logs: `docker compose logs zen-mcp`
- Ensure Docker has enough resources (memory/disk space)
- Try rebuilding: `docker compose build --no-cache`

**"spawn ENOENT" or execution issues**
- Verify the container is running: `docker compose ps`
- Check that Docker Desktop is running
- On Windows: Ensure WSL2 is properly configured for Docker

**Testing your Docker setup:**
```bash
# Check if services are running
docker compose ps

# Test manual connection
docker exec -i zen-mcp-server echo "Connection test"

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```
